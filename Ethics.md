#### Case Study: 
- Uber Greyball Scandal (2017)
    - Problem Uber faced:
        - In many cities (e.g., Portland, Boston, Paris), Uber operated without regulatory approval. Local governments tried to catch Uber drivers who were violating transport laws.
    - Uber’s response:
        - Instead of complying, Uber built secret software called Greyball to identify and block government officials who were investigating them.
    - How Greyball worked:
        - It collected data (like credit card info, device patterns, geolocation) to guess who might be a government inspector.
        - If the system detected an inspector, it showed them a fake version of the app — no cars appeared, or fake cars circled endlessly.
        - This made it very hard for authorities to prove illegal Uber activity.
    - Why it may have ethically mattered:
        - Deception against public authorities.
        - Risk to public safety (unregulated drivers).
        - Business goals prioritized over law and public trust

- Facebook & Cambridge Analytica (2018)
    - Problem Facebook faced:
        - Facebook’s platform allowed third-party apps to access users' personal data freely.
        - Facebook had weak oversight over how this data was used once collected by external developers.
        - They trusted that app developers would self-regulate — but did not monitor effectively.
    - Facebook’s response:
        - Facebook initially allowed apps to collect not just user data but friends' data — without friends' explicit consent.
        - When Facebook learned Cambridge Analytica had harvested tens of millions of profiles:
            - It asked them to delete the data. It did not independently verify that they complied. Facebook did not inform users affected by the breach until years later.
    - How it caused a problem:
        - A seemingly harmless app ("This Is Your Digital Life" personality quiz) collected massive amounts of data.
        - Cambridge Analytica bought this data from the app developer. They used it to build psychological profiles and micro-target political ads. Potentially influenced political outcomes without informed consent.
    - Why it may have ethically mattered:
        - Users never agreed to have their personal data (or their friends' data) harvested for political profiling.
        - Facebook withheld disclosure of the breach for a long time.
        - Facebook did not ensure data was used ethically after collection.
        - Created vulnerabilities where personal data could shape political behavior covertly
